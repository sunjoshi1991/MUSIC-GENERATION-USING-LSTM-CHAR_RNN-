# MUSIC-GENERATION-USING-LSTM-CHAR_RNN-
GENERATING (PREDICTING) NEXT CHARACTER OF MUSICAL NOTES(TEXT) UISNG CHAR RNN(LSTM)
TASK IS TO PREDICT THE NEXT CHARCATER FROM GIVEN INPUT TEXT(MUSICAL NOTE) DATA
DEVELOPED A LSTM (RNN) MODEL WITH EMBEDDING ,DROPOUT AND SOFTMAX ACTIVATION WHICH GIVES 90% TRAIN ACCURACY GIVEN THE SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE.

TO RUN THIS FISRT RUN train.py which trains the model with weights and char_to_idx_file
and then sample.py --len seed to generate the predicted char.

To test use this link: https://www.abcjs.net/abcjs-editor.html , copy paste the generated sample O/P and then play.
